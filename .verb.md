This is inspired by the `file.stat` code in [vinyl-fs][]. I needed a function that essentially did the same thing but could be used with either stream or non-stream code.

## Usage

```js
{%= replace(docs("example.js"), "./", name) %}
```

## API

The sync methods use getters/setters to lazily add `stat` or `lstat` to the file object. 

{%= apidocs('index.js') %}

## History

**v0.2.0**

- adds `.lstat`, `.stat`, `.lstatSync` and `.statSync` methods
- the `.getStats` async method was renamed to `.stat` for consistency with the added methods
